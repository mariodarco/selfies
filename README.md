# Selfies
"A collection of macros for quicker development"

Another day at work, or on your personal project, and you need to create yet another class, which comes with the user boilerplate:
- The initialiser needs to be defined, with n parameters
- Inside that, the usual ```@param = param```, multiplied for how many params you've got there
- Then it's the turn of the attr_reader for those parameters
- Then you are likely to need a class method that does nothing else than initialising the class and calling an instance method of the same name
- more?

This gets boring with the years. So boring that someone might decide to write some macros to reduce the boilerplate.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'selfies'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install selfies
```

## Usage

*** self_init *** can be used to automatically generate an initialiser for your class

This code:
```ruby
class Search
  self_init :term, :page, :limit
end
```

Is equivalent to
```ruby
class Search
  attr_reader :term, :page, :limit

  def initialize(term, page, limit)
    @term = term
    @page = page
    @limit = limit
  end
end
```

## Next Steps
*** self_init ***
- Implement the possibility to pass defaults
- Specify which parameters will get an attr_reader, attr_accessor or none
- Specify wich parameters on attr_reader are to consider private

## Development

Ruby version:
```
2.4.1
```

Fork the project, clone the repository and bundle:
```
>> git clone https://github.com/{your_account}/selfies.git
>> cd selfies
```

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
